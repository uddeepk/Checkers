# Checkers

This is a code for checkers game.

I used this to practice OOP, and conditional programming. 

I have still yet to fully understand OOP, and pointer implementation.

It took me approx 9 hours to do this. Because I had a template without oop to build up from.

This is the best operational version for now.
